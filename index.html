<h1>Hush Puppies</h1>
<h2>Shoes or Food?</h2>
<p>Welcome to my website.  I'm pretty confused.  I was having a wonderful dinner recently, and the waiter brought me some complimentary Hush Puppies.  I was rather taken aback by this, for I always believed that Hush Puppies were a type of sneaker.  I don't usually eat sneakers!  These sneakers are delicious!!!  As you can see, I'm a bit confused.  What is a Hush Puppy? A Shoe or food? Or a dog?
